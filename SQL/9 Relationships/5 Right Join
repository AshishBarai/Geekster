SQL Relationship Right Join

A Right Join (or Right Outer Join) in SQL is used to retrieve all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, the result will include NULL values for the columns from the left table.

# Key Points
> All Rows from Right Table: The result set includes all rows from the right table.
> Matching Rows from Left Table: Only the rows with matching values in the left table are included.
> Non-Matching Rows: For rows in the right table with no corresponding rows in the left table, the result will include NULL for columns from the left table.

Syntax
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

# Example
Imagine we have two tables, customers and orders. We want to list all orders, including those that do not have a corresponding customer.

SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id, orders.order_date
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

> The query selects the name from the customers table and order_id and order_date from the orders table.
> The RIGHT JOIN operation ensures that all orders are listed, even if they do not have a corresponding customer.
> If an order does not have an associated customer, the name field will show NULL.
