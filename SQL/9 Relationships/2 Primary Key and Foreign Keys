SQL relationship - Primary Key and Foreign Keys

# Understanding Primary Key
A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified, which prevents duplicate rows. The primary key must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values.
Key Points:
> Uniqueness: No Two rows can have the same primary key value.
> Non - Null: Every row must have a value for the primary key.
> Single or Composite: A Primary key can consist of a single column or multiple columns

Example:
> Customer Table: the order_id column can be the primary key, uniquely identifying each other.
CREATE TABLE customers
(
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(100)
);

# Understanding Foreign Key
A Foreign Key is a column (or a set of columns) in one table that references the Primary Key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, ensuring that the value in the foreign key column corresponds to a valid value in the referenced primary key column.
Ket Points:
> Referential Integrity: The foreign key ensures that the relationship between tables is maintained, preventing actions that would destroy links between tables.
> Multiple Foreign Keys: A table can have more than one foreign key, each pointing to a different primary key in different tables.

Example: 
> Orders table: The customer_id column in the Order table can be a foreign key that reference the customer_id in the Orders table.
CREATE TABLE orders
(
id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
order_date DATE NOT NULL,
amount DECIMAL(8,2),
customer_id INT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);

Primary Key: In the Customers table, id would be the primary key, uniquely identifying each customer.
Foreign Key: In the Orders table, customer_id would be a foreign key, creating a link between Orders and Customers, ensuring each order is associated with a valid customer.
