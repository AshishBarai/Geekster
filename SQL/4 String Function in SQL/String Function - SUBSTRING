# SQL String Function - SUBSTRING

The SUBSTRING function in SQL is used to extract a specific portion of a string. 
This function is highly useful when you need to retrieve a segment of a string based 
on its position and length.

# How SUBSTRING Works
The SUBSTRING function takes three arguments:

1.The string from which to extract the substring.
2.The starting position of the substring.
3.The length of the substring to be extracted.

Basic Syntax
SUBSTRING(string, start_positino, length);

SELECT SUBSTRIN('Hello World', 1,4);
Here the out outout would be:
  Hell

SELECT SUBSTRIN('Hello World', 3,8);
Here the out outout would be:
  llo Worl

SELECT SUBSTRIN('Hello World', 7);
Here the out outout would be:
  World

SELECT SUBSTRIN('Hello World', -3);
Here the out outout would be:
  rld

SELECT SUBSTRIN('Hello World', 7,6548614);
Here the out outout would be:
  World

Example From DataBase:
SELECT SUBSTRING(title,1,10)
FROM books;
Explanation:

>SUBSTRING(title, 1, 10): This extracts the first 10 characters from the title column in 
the books table.
>The result will be a list of book titles truncated to the first 10 characters.

SELECT CONCAT(SUBSTRING(title,1,10),'...') as Title
FROM books;
Explanation:

>SUBSTRING(title, 1, 10): Extracts the first 10 characters from the title column.
>CONCAT(SUBSTRING(title, 1, 10), '...'): Concatenates the extracted substring with an 
ellipsis.
>AS Title: Provides an alias for the resulting concatenated string, making the output 
column name Title.
