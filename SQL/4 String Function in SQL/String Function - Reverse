# SQL String Function - Reverse
The "REVERSE' function in SQL is used to reverse the characters in a string. It is particularly
usedful in situattions where you need to manipulate or analyze string data in a reverse order.

Example useage:
SELECT REVERSE('Hello World')
Output: dlroW olleH
In this example, the string 'Hello World' is reversed to 'dlroW olleH'.

# Parctical use case - Checking for Palindromes
A palindrome is a word, pharase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same 
forward and backward (Ignoring space, punctuation, and capitalization). The "REVERSE' function
can be used to help check for palindromes.

Example:

SELECT CONCATE('hello', REVERSE('hello')) AS palindrome;
Output: helloolleh

In this case, we are concatenating the word 'hello' with its reversed form to get 
'helloolleh'. This example demonstrates how to use the REVERSE function alongside CONCAT 
to manipulate strings.
