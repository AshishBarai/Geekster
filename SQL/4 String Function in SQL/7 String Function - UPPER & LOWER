# SQL String Function - UPPER & LOWER

# For UPPER Function 
 The UPPER function in SQL is used to convert all characters in a string to uppercase. 
 This can be particularly useful when you want to standardize the case of text data for 
 comparisons or display purposes

 Example:
 SELECT UPPER('Hello World') AS upper_case;
 OUTPUT: HELLO WORLD
 In this example, the string 'Hello World' is converted to all uppercase letters, 
 resulting in 'HELLO WORLD'.

 # For LOWER Function
The LOWER function in SQL is used to convert all characters in a string to lowercase. 
This is useful for ensuring consistency in text data, especially when performing 
case-insensitive comparisons.

 Example:
 SELECT LOWER('Hello World') AS lower_case;
 OUTPUT: hello world
 In this example, the string 'Hello World' is converted to all lowercase letters, 
 resulting in 'hello world'.

# Practical Use Case - Converting Book Titles to Lowercase
Suppose we have a table of books and we want to convert all book titles to lowercase. 
We can use the LOWER function to achieve this.
 
SELECT LOWER(title) 
FROM books;
This query will return the titles of all books in the table, converted to lowercase.
