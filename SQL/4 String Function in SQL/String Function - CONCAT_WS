# SQL String Function - CONCAT_WS (Word Seperator)

The 'CONCAT_WS' function in SQL is a useful tool for concatenating strings with a specified 
separator between each string. This function is particularly handy when you want to join 
multiple columns with a specific delimiter.


# Using CONCAT_WS to Combine Book Titles and Author Names
The 'CONCAT_WS' function allows you to join multiple strings together with a specified 
separator. In this example, we combine the title, author_fname, and author_lname columns 
from the books table to create a descriptive string for each book.

SELECT CONCAT_WS(' - ',title,author_fname,author_lname) AS book_title
FROM books;

In this query, the CONCAT_WS function concatenates the title, author_fname, and author_lname columns with a " - " separator, resulting in a combined string that clearly identifies each book and its author.

Benefits of Using CONCAT_WS:
> Readability: Makes combined strings more readable by using a specified separator.
> Flexibility: Easily concatenate multiple columns with any delimiter of your choice.
> Simplicity: Simplifies the process of creating descriptive strings from multiple columns.
