# SQL String Function - REPLACE

In SQL, the 'REPLACE' function is used to substitute all occurences of as specified substring
within a string with another substring. It is a case-sensitive function, meaning it distinguished
between uppercase and lowercase characters.

Basic Syntax
REPLACE(string, old_substring, new_substring)

Example:
SELECT ('Hello World', 'Hell', 'Y') AS string;
Outout: 'Yo World'
Explanation:
>'Hello World': The original string.
>'Hell': The substring to be replaced.
>'Y': The new substring that will replace 'Hell'.
>Result: The substring 'Hell' is replaced with 'Y'.


SELECT CONCAT(SUBSTRING(REPLACE(title,'e',3), 1, 10), '...') AS Title
FROM books;
