# SQL String Function - CONCAT

# In SQL, the 'CONCAT' function is a powerful tool for combining multiple strings into one. 
This can be particularly useful for creating full names from separate first and last name 
columns in a table.

# For Example:
Using Concat to combine First and Last Names
The 'Concat' functions allows us to join strings together. In this example, we combine the 
'author_fname' and 'author_lname' columns from the 'books' table to creat a full name for each
author

SELECT CONCAT(author_fname,' ',author_lname) AS full_name
FROM books;

This query will output the full names of authors by concatenating their first and last names with a space in between.
