# Inserting Challenge

This script demonstrates how to create a table and insert records, including inserting 
multiple records at once.

-- Insert Challenge
-- Create a people table
CREATE TABLE people
(
firt_name varchar(20),
last_name varchar(20),
age int
);
This command creates a table named people with three columns: first_name, last_name, and 
age. The first_name and last_name columns can store text up to 20 characters long, and the
age column stores integer values.


-- Insert single record:
insert into people values
('Tina','Belcher',13);
This command inserts a record into the people table with first_name as 'Tina', last_name as
'Belcher', and age as 13.


-- Insert your 2nd person
insert into people values
('bob','belcher',42);
This command inserts another record into the people table with first_name as 'bob', 
last_name as 'belcher', and age as 42.


-- Insert multiple records:
insert into people values
('linda','belcher',45),
('phillip','frond',38),
('calvin','Fischoeder',70)
This command inserts multiple records into the people table in a single statement.
