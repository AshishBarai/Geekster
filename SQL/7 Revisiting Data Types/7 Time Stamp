SQL Revisiting Datatypes - Timestamp

The 'TIMESTAMP' datatypes in SQL is used to store both the date and time of an event, typically in the format
 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. It is similar to the 'DATETIME' datatype, but with some key differences, 
 particulary in how it handles time zones and automatic updates.

# Key Features of 'TIMESTAMP':
> Date and Time Storage: TIMESTAMP stores both date and time information, making it useful for tracking events down to the second.
> Automatic Updates: TIMESTAMP columns can automatically update to the current date and time whenever the row is modified. This feature is particularly useful for keeping track of the last update time of a record.
> Time Zone Awareness: Unlike DATETIME, the TIMESTAMP datatype is time zone-aware. It stores the date and time as UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and converts it back to the local time zone when retrieved. 

Syntax
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_name VARCHAR(255),
    event_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

# Example 1: Storing a 'TIMESTAMP'
INSERT INTO events (event_name, event_timestamp)
VALUES ('Meeting', '2024-08-15 10:30:00');

This will insert a new row into the events table with the specified date and time.

# Example 2: Automatic 'TIMESTAMP' Update
CREATE TABLE user_logins (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    login_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

In this example, the login_time column will automatically update to the current time 
every time the row is updated.

# Practical Use Cases
> Tracking Changes: Use TIMESTAMP to record when a record was last modified. This is particularly useful for logging or auditing purposes.
> Event Logging: Ideal for applications where you need to track when specific events occur, such as user logins, transactions, or system events.
> Time Zone Management: Since TIMESTAMP is time zone-aware, it is useful in applications that need to handle data across multiple time zones.
