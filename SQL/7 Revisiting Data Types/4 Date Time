#SQL Revisiting Data Types - Date Time

In SQL, managing date and time values is crucial for handling temporal data effectively.
Understanding the various data types and function related to date and time can help you store,
query, and manipulate such data accurately.

# DATA function: Valus with a Date But no Time
> Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
> Description: The 'DATE' data types is used to store date values without any accociated time.
This is ideal for feilds where only the date is important, such as birthdates or event dates.

# TIME Function: Values with Time but No Date
> Formart: 'HH:MM:SS'
> Description: The 'TIME' data type stores time values without an associated date. This is 
useful for fields that track time-specific data, like hours worked or time of an 
appointment.

# DATETIME values with a Date AND TIME
> Format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
> The DATETIME data type combines both date and time into a single value. This is 
perfect for timestamping events that require precise tracking of both the date and the 
exact time, such as logging transactions or recording events.

Practical Examples: 
Inserting values with DATE, TIME, and DATETIME
INSERT INTO datepeople(name, birth_date, birth_time, birth_date_time)
VALUES('AJ','1999-12-11','12:30:23','1999-08-20 12:30:23');
Explanation:
> '1999-12-11': The birth date without any time.
> '12:30:23': The birth time without any date.
> '1999-08-20 12:30:23': A complete datetime value that includes both date and time.

# Current DATE and TIME functions:
> CURDATE(): Returns the current date.
> CURTIME(): Retruns the currect time.
> NOW(): Returns the currect date and timee.

Inserting Current Date, Time, and DateTime
INSERT INTO datepeople (name, birth_date, birth_time, birth_date_time)
VALUES ('sahil',CURDATE(),CURTIME(), NOW());
Explanation:
> CURDATE(): Inserts the current date.
> CURTIME(): Inserts the current time.
> NOW(): Inserts both the current date and time.
