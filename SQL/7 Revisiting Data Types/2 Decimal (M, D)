# SQL Revisiting Data types - Decimal (M,D)

 # Formate Decimal(M,D)

The DECIMAL(M, D) data type in SQL is used to store numeric values with fixed precision and scale.

# Understanding the Parameters:
> M: Represents the total number of digits (precision). The range for M is 1 to 65 digits.
> D: Represents the number of digits to the right of the decimal point (scale). The range for D is 0 to 30.
Rule: M must always be greater than or equal to D.

Creating a Table with DECIMAL:
CREATE TABLE items(price DECIMAL(4.3));
Here, DECIMAL(4, 3) means:

Precision (M): 4 digits total.
Scale (D): 3 digits after the decimal point.

Example:1
INSERT INTO items(price)
VALUES(3);
Output would be 3.000 since the precision is set to 4 and scale to 3, the output will have one digit before the decimal and three zeros after it.

Example 2:
INSERT INTO(price)
VALUES(43215);
Outout would be Error
Sine The value 43215 exceeds the maximum allowed precision of 4 digits, so it throws an error.

Example 3:
INSERT INTO(price)
VALUES(285.99)
Output would be 286.00 as the value 285.99 rounds up to 286.000 due to the precision and scale settings.

Key Points:
> DECIMAL(M, D) is ideal for storing precise financial data where exact decimal representation is needed.
> Always ensure that the value being inserted does not exceed the defined precision.
