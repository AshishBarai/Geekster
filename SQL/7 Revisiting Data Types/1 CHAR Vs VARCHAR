# Revisiting the data types Char Vs Varchar

# Char Vs Varchar

# CHAR:
> Fixed Length: CHAR will always have a fixed length.
> Performance: CHAR is faster if we know the length of the characters

Example Use Cases:
> State Abbreviation: DL(Delhi), UP(Utter Pradesh), NY(New York) - each having 2 characters.
> Gender: M(male) and F(Female).
When to use CHAR:
> whenever we know there is going to be fixed length character, we use CHAR for faster performance.

# VARCHAR:
> Variable Length: VARCHAR stores variable characters and does not store any fixed values.
> Flexibility: Use VARCHAR when the length of the characters is unknown.
Example Use Case:
> address
> email

# Space Considerations:
> CHAR(5): This will store 5 bytes of space for every data entry, even if we are using only 1 or 3 characters like M (Male)/F (Female) or Yes/No.
> VARCHAR(100): This will store space according to the need. For example, if we use the name 'Ashish' which has 6 characters, it will take up 6 bytes of space only.

# Summary: 
> Use CHAR for fixed length data to imporve performance.
> Use VARCHAR for variable length data to save space
