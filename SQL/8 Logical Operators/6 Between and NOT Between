SQL Logical operators - Between

The BETWEEN operator is useful when selecting a range of values from sales data, such as sales amounts, dates, or product prices. It is inclusive, meaning it includes both the start and end values of the range.
> Example 1:
SELECT product_name, sales_date
FROM sales
WHERE sales_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
This query will return all products that were sold within the year 2023, including January 1st and December 31st.

Example 2:
SELECT product_name, sales_amount
FROM sales
WHERE sales_amount BETWEEN 500 AND 1000;
This query will return all products with sales amounts between $500 and $1000, including both $500 and $1000.

Example 3: and for NOT BETWEEN
SELECT product_name, sales_amount
FROM sales
WHERE sales_amount NOT BETWEEN 500 AND 1000;
This query will return products where the sales amount is not between $500 and $1000. This is useful if you're looking for sales that are either below $500 or above $1000.

Example 4:
SELECT product_name, sales_date
FROM sales
WHERE sales_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31';
