SQL Logical operators - 'AND &&'

The AND operator in SQL is used to combine two or more conditions in a WHERE clause. All the conditions combined with AND must be true for the row to be included in the result set. It is commonly used when you need to filter records that meet multiple criteria.

Example 1:
SELECT title, author_lname, released_year
FROM books
WHERE author_lname = 'Eggers' AND released_year > 2011;

This query retrieves book titles, the author's last name, and the release year for books where the author_lname is 'Eggers' and the released_year is greater than 2011. Both conditions must be true for a book to be included in the results.

Example 2:
SELECT * 
FROM books
WHERE author_lname = 'smith' AND released_year > 2000 AND genre = 'Fiction';
This query retrieves titles, author last names, and release years of books where the author_lname is 'Smith', the released_year is after 2000, and the genre is 'Fiction'. All three conditions must be true for the records to be selected.
