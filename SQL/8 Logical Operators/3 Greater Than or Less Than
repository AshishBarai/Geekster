SQL Logical operators - Greater Than or Less than

In SQL, the > (greater than) and < (less than) operators are used to filter records based on numerical or date values. These operators allow you to retrieve records where the specified column's value is greater than or less than a certain value.

# Using the '>'(Greater Than) operator
> The '>' operator retunrs records where the column's value is greater than the specified value.
> Example 1:
SELECT title, released_year
FROM books
WHERE released_year > 2000
This query retrieves all book titles and their release years where the released_year is greater than 2000, meaning it will include books released after the year 2000.

# Using the '>='(greater than or equal to) operator
> The >= operator returns records where the column's value is greater than or equal to the specified value.
> Example 2:
> This query retrieves all book titles and their release years where the released_year is 2000 or later. This includes books released in 2000 as well as those released after 2000.
SELECT title, released_year
FROM books
WHERE released_year => 2000

# Using the '<'(Less Than) operator
> The < operator returns records where the column's value is less than the specified value.
> Example 3:
SELECT title, released_year
FROM books
WHERE released_year < 2000;
This query retrieves all book titles and their release years where the released_year is before 2000, meaning it will include books released before the year 2000.

> Using the '<='(Less than or equal to) operator
The <= operator returns records where the column's value is less than or equal to the specified value.
Example 4:
SELECT title, released_year
FROM books
WHERE released_year <= 2000;
This query retrieves all book titles and their release years where the released_year is 2000 or earlier. This includes books released in 2000 and before.

These operators are essential for filtering numerical and date data in SQL queries.
