SQL Logical operators - Not Equal ('!=' OR '<>')

The "Not Equal" operator in SQL is used to filter out results that do not match a specified value. It is the complement of the equal (=) operator. In SQL, you can use either != or <> as the "Not Equal" operator.

# Understanding the NOT equal Operator
When you use the "Not Equal" operator, SQL returns all records where the specified column's value does not match the given value.

> For example 1: Filtering Books by released year
SELECT titile
FROM books
WHERE released_year = 2017

in this example the result will return the values where the released year is 2017 but in 
not equal to or compliment for equal

SELECT title
FROM books 
WHERE released_year != 2017
This query returns all book titles where the release year is not 2017. It will exclude any records where the release year is exactly 2017.

Example 2: Filerting Books by author
SELECT title, author_fname
FROM books
WHERE author_fname != 'David';
This query returns all titles and authors' first names from the books table where the author's first name is not 'David'. It filters out any records where the author's first name is 'David'.
