SQL Logical operators - Not Equal

in simple terms it is a compliment of equal operators

For example:
SELECT titile
FROM books
WHERE released_year = 2017
 in this example the result will return the values where the released year is 2017 but in 
not equal to or compliment for equal
SELECT title
FROM books 
WHERE released_year != 2017

Example 2:
SELECT title, author_fname
FROM books
WHERE author_fname != 'David';
