SQL Logical Operators - IN / NOT IN 

The IN operator is a shorthand for using multiple OR conditions, while NOT IN is a shorthand for using multiple AND conditions with negation.

Example 1:
SELECT sale_id, customer_name
FROM sales
WHERE customer_name = 'Alice' OR customer_name = 'Bob' OR customer_name = 'Charlie';

With IN Operator:
Instead of repeating OR, you can use the IN operator:

SELECT sale_id, customer_name
FROM sales
WHERE customer_name IN ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie');

This will fetch sales records for customers named Alice, Bob, and Charlie.

With NOT IN Operator:
If you want to exclude sales records for these customers:

SELECT sale_id, customer_name
FROM sales
WHERE customer_name NOT IN ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie');

This will fetch sales records for customers other than Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
