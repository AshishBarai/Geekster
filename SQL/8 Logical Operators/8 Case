SQL logical operators - case

The CASE operator is used to replace the traditional IF-THEN-ELSE statement. It allows you to specify conditions, and if a condition is met, it returns the corresponding result; otherwise, it provides an alternative.

Syntax:
CASE 
  WHEN ___ THEN ___
  .
  .
  .
  ELSE END

Example 1:
SELECT product_name, 
CASE 
  WHEN sales_date > '2020-01-01' THEN 'New Product' 
  ELSE 'Legacy Product' 
END AS Product_Category
FROM sales;

This would categorize products as "New Product" if they were sold after January 1, 2020, and "Legacy Product" if sold before that date.
