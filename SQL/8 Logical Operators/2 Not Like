SQL Logical Operators - NOT LIKE

The NOT LIKE operator in SQL is the complement of the LIKE operator. While the LIKE operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column, the NOT LIKE operator excludes results that match the pattern.

# Understanding 'LIKE' and 'NOT LIKE' operators

# Like Operators:
The LIKE operator is used to search for a specific pattern in a column. For example, if we want to find all book titles that start with the letter "W", we would use:
Example 1:
SELECT title
FROM books
WHERE title LIKE 'W%'
this will give the result where 'W' is included in title but for not like operator will give the result where 'W' is not included.

SELECT title
FROM books
WHERE title NOT LIKE 'W%
This query returns all book titles that do not start with the letter "W".

# Example 2:
If we want to count the number of books released in the 2000s, we would use:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM books
WHERE released_year LIKE '20%';

this query will give the result where the books were released after or from 2000 year, and if we
want to exclude the year of 2000 then
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM books
WHERE released_year LIKE '20%';
This query counts all books released after 2000, excluding those released specifically in the year 2000.
