About the READ Command in CRUD
The READ command in CRUD operations is used to retrieve data from 
a database. This operation is typically performed using the SQL SELECT 
statement, which allows you to fetch data based on specific criteria.

Selecting All Columns:
To select all columns from a table:
SELECT * 
FROM fish
The * symbol means it selects all the columns in the fish table.

Selecting Specific Columns:
If you want to select a particular column, you can specify the column name:
SELECT column_name 
FROM fish

For example, to select the name and age columns:
for two columns:
SELECT name, age 
FROM fish

Using the WHERE Clause:
The WHERE clause is used to filter records based on specific conditions.

To select all columns where the age is 4:
SELECT * 
FROM fish
WHERE age = 4;

To select all columns where the name is "egg":
SELECT * 
FROM fish
WHERE name = "egg";

The WHERE clause filters the rows according to the given condition. It is also case
insensitive, meaning it does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters 
in string comparisons.

# About ALIAS 'AS'
The AS keyword in SQL is used to assign an alias to a column or table, providing a 
temporary name that can make your query results more readable and meaningful. Here are 
detailed examples:

Example 1: Alias for a Column
To give a temporary name to the fish_id column:

SELECT fish_id AS id, name
FROM fish;
In this query, fish_id is temporarily renamed to id for the duration of the query.

Example 2: Alias with Spaces
To include spaces in the alias name, you can use double quotes:
SELECT fish_id AS "fish id", name
FROM fish;

Benefits of Using Aliases:
1.Improves Readability: Makes column names more descriptive and easier to understand.
2.Handles Name Conflicts: Useful when joining tables with columns of the same name.
3.Simplifies Complex Expressions: Makes complex expressions or calculations easier to reference.
