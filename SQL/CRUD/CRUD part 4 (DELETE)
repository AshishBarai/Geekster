# About the DELETE Command in CRUD:(delete Existing data)
> The DELETE command is used to remove existing data from a table. This operation 
affects the data within the table, not the structure of the table itself.

# Deleting Specific rows
for example if we want to delete To delete specific rows based on a condition, we can 
use the DELETE command with a WHERE clause.
DELETE 
FROM fish
WHERE name = "ringo";
DELETE FROM fish: Specifies the fish table.
WHERE name = "ringo": Deletes rows where the name is "ringo".

# To remove all rows from a table while keeping the table structure intact, you omit 
the WHERE clause.
DELETE 
FROM fish;
This command deletes all the data from the fish table, but the schema (table structure) 
remains intact.


# FOR example Queries: 

> Delete specific age:
DELETE 
FROM fish
WHERE age = 4;
DELETE FROM fish: Specifies the fish table.
WHERE age = 4: Deletes all rows where the age is 4.

> Delete Based on condition:
DELETE
FROM fish
WHERE fish_id = age;
DELETE FROM fish: Specifies the fish table.
WHERE fish_id = age: Deletes all rows where the fish_id is equal to age.

> Delete all fish data
DELETE 
FROM fish;
This command deletes all rows in the fish table but keeps the table schema intact.

Checking Table Stucture:
DESC fish;
DESC fish: Displays the structure of the fish table, including column names, data types, 
and constraints.

KEY POINTS:
> The DELETE command removes data but not the table structure.
> Use the WHERE clause to specify conditions for deletion.
> Omitting the WHERE clause deletes all rows in the table.
> The table schema remains intact after a DELETE operation.
