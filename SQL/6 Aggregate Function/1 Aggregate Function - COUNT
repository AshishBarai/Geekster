# SQL Aggregate Function - COUNT

# What is an aggregate function ?
Aggregate functions in SQL allow us to perform calculations on multiple 
rows of similar data and return a single result. They are often used with 
the GROUP BY clause to group rows that share a common value.

# About COUNT
The count function in SQL counts the numbers of rows in a table or the number of NON-NULL
values in a specified column.

Syntax
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;
This Query counts the total number of rows in the table and returns the count.

Example:
> Counting all rows in the table:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM books;
This query returns the total number of rows in the books table.

> Counting specific columns:
SELECT COUNT(author_fname, author_lname)
FROM books;
This query counts the number of rows where both author_fname and author_lname are not NULL
in the books table.

> Counting rows with a specific condition:
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM books
WHERE title
LIKE '%the%';
This query returns the count of rows where the title contains the word 'the'.
