# SQL Aggregate function - Subquery

# Understating Subquery
A subquery, also known as an innner query or nested query, is a query within another SQL query.
The subquery is executed first, and its result is used by the outer query.

Syntax:
SELECT col1, col2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT column_name FROM  table_name WHERE condition);

Example:
To select all columns from the 'books' tabke where the number of pages is the minimum value
found in the table:
SELECT * 
FROM books
WHERE PAGES IN (SELECT MIN(pages) FROM books);

Explanation:
1. subquery execution:
SELECT MIN(pages) FROM books;
This subquery retrieves the minmum number of pages from the 'books' table.

2. Outer Query Execution:
SELECT * FROM books WHERE pages IN (subquery_result);

The outer query uses the result of the subquery to filter and select rows where the number 
of pages matches the minimum value found.

When to use subqueries:
> When you need to perform multiple steps of data retrieval.
> When you want to filter results based on the outcome of another query.
> For breaking down complex query into more manageable parts.
