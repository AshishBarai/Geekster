# Understating SUM
The SUM function calculates the total sum of a numeric column. This can be useful for summarizing data, such as finding the total stock quantity of books.

FROM books;

FROM books
GROUP BY author
This query returns the total stock quantity for each author, providing a summary of how many books each author has in stock.
