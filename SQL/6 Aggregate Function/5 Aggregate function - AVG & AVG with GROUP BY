# SQL Aggregate function - AVG & AVG with GROUP BY

# Understanding AVERAGE
What is average ?
Average is calculated by dividing the total quantity by the count of observations.

Basic Syntax:
To calculate the average in SQL, we can use the AVG function:
SELECT col1, AVG(col2), col3, ...
FROM books
GROUP BY col1;

Example:
SELECT released_year, AVG(stock_quantity)
FROM books
GROUP BY released_year;
Explanation:
> SELECT released_year, AVG(stock_quantity): Selects the year of release and calculates the average stock quantity for each year.
> FROM books: Specifies the books table.
> GROUP BY released_year: Groups the results by the released_year column, so the average is calculated for each year.
