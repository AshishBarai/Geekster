# SQL - Selection refining - LIMIT

# Understanding LIMIT
The 'LIMIT' clause helps to retrict the number of rows returned in the result set. This 
particularly useful when we want to fetch the top records from a table, either for analysis
or to improve performance by limit the amount of data processed and returned..

# Syntax of LIMIT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows;
> number_of_rows This specifies the maximum number of rows to return.

# Example 1: Basic Usages of LIMIT
SELECT title
FROM books
LIMIT 3;
In this example, the query returns the top 3 titles from the 'book' table. Since there is 
no specific condition, it simply fetches the first 3 records based on the defaul ordering of 
the table.

# Example 2: Using LIMIT with ORDER BY
SELECT title, released_year
FROM books
ORDER BY released_year DESC
LIMIT 3;
In this query, we combine the 'LIMIT' clause with the 'ORDER BY' clause. Here, the query sorts
 the books by 'released_year' in decending order (i.e., from the most recent to the oldest)
 and then returns the top 3 latest books.

# Practical Applications
> Top-N analysis: fetching the top N records, such as the top 5 highest scores, top 10 latest
tansactions, etc.
> Pagination: Implementing pagination in application to display a subset of data on each page.

#Example Use Case
> Top 5 Highest salaries:
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employee
ORDERS BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5;

> Top 10 Recent Ordes:
SELECT order_id, order_date
FROM orders
ORDER BY order_date DESC
LIMIT 10;

By understanding nd utilizing the 'LIMIT' clause, we can make our SQL queries more efficient 
and tailored to our specific needs.
