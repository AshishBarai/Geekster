# Selection Refining in SQL - DISTINCT

# Understanding DISTINCT
The DISTINCT keyword in SQL is used to remove duplicate values from a result set. 
It ensures that the data returned from a query contains only unique values. Importantly, 
using DISTINCT does not alter the data in the main table; it simply affects the output of 
your query.

Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT <column_name>
FROM <table_name>;

Basic Example:
To illustrate, suppose you want to retrieve unique last names from the books table. 
You would use the following query:

SELECT DISTTINCT(author_lname)
FROM books;
This query will return a list of unique last names from the books table.

>Handling Multiple Columns
Sometimes, you might have different first names but duplicate last names, and you want 
to ensure each combination of first and last names is unique. You can achieve this by 
using DISTINCT with CONCAT or a comma separation.

Example using CONCAT
SELECT DISTINCT(CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname)) AS full_name
FROM books;
This query will return unique full names by combining the first and last names.

Example using Multiple Columns:
SELECT DISTINCT author_fname, author_lname
FROM books;
This query will return unique combinations of first and last names from the books table.

By using the DISTINCT keyword, you can ensure your query results are free of duplicates,
leading to more accurate data analysis and reporting. Whether you're working with 
customer records, product lists, or any other dataset, DISTINCT helps you achieve 
clarity and precision in your results.
