SQL Selection Refining - LIKE

# Understanding LIKE:
> The LIKE keywords is used in SQL to search for a specified pattern in a column. It is 
often used with wildcard to create more fleible search conditions.

# Wildcard is LIKE
> '%': Represent zero, one, or multiple characters.
> '_': Represent single characters

Example:
> '%ing%: Matches any string ending or starting with 'ing', such as 'King', 'living', or 'Anything'.
> '_ing': MAtches any string with one characters before 'ing', such as 'King', 'sing'

# Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, columnc3, ...
FROM books
WHERE column_name
LIKE pattern;
or
SELECT column1, column2, columnc3, ...
FROM books
WHERE coloumn_name
LIKE pattern;


# Example 1: Using '%'
SELECT title, CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author_name
FROM books
WHERE author_fname LIKE '%da';
This query will return all rows where 'author_fname' ends with 'da'.

# Example 2: Using '_'
SELECT title, CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author_name
FROM books
WHERE author_fname LIKE 'da_';
This query will return all rows where author_fname is exactly three characters long and starts with 'da'.

# Example 3: Using '%' for partial matches
SELECT title, CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author_name
FROM books
WHERE author_fname LIKE '%da%';
This query will return all rows where author_fname contains 'da' anywhere in the string.
