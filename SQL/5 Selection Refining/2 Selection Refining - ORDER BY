# SQL Selection Refining - ORDER BY

# Understanding ORDER BY
The 'ORDER BY' clause is a powerful tool in SQL that allows you to sort the result set of a 
query by one or more columns. This can be done either in ascending(ASC) or descending(DESC)
order.

# Syntax 
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;  (here is we do not write somthing then the order will happen in 
  assending order which is a default setting, and to sort the values by descending order
  we can you key word DESC)

Example:
To sort by a specific column, we can write:
SELECT title
FROM books
ORDER BY released_year;
This sorts the results by the released_year column in ascending order. If no sorting 
order is specified, ascending order is the default.

# Sorting Alphabetically And Numerically
We can sort results both alphabetically and numberically.
Example:
SELECT title, author_fname
FROM books
ORDER BY author_fname DESC;
This query sorts the result by the 'author_fname' column in decending order, so the names
will be listed from Z to A.

# Using Column Index for Sorting
We can also use the index of the column in the 'ORDER BY' clause.

Example:
 SELECT title, author_fname
FROM books
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
In this query, the result are sorted by the second column, 'author_fname', in descending order.

# Multiple Sorting Criteria
We can set multiple sorting to sort the result based on more than one column.

Example:
SELECT title, author_fname, released_year, stock_quantity
FROM books
ORDER BY title ASC, released_year DESC;
In this example, the results are first sorted by title in ascending order and then by 
released_year in descending order. This means the primary sorting is done by title, and 
within each title, the results are sorted by released_year from the latest to the oldest.

Using the ORDER BY clause efficiently is a fundamental skill in SQL that enhances your 
ability to organize and retrieve data in a meaningful way. Whether you need to sort 
results alphabetically or numerically, or apply multiple sorting criteria, mastering 
ORDER BY will significantly improve your data querying capabilities.
